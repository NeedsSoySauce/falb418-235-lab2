# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Feras Albaroudi. I don't have much to say about myself, so I spent a few minutes writing random things using GitHub's [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).

## Lists

The following is a list of my favourite animals in no order.

* Sloths
* Goats
* Alpacas

If I had to put them order of the one I like most though...

1. Goats
2. Alpacas
3. Sloths

## Code highlighting

My favourite number is `7` is an example of an inline code block. 

```python
print("This is an example of a code block with syntax highlighting!");
```

## Tables

Tables are cool. They can be used to present things in a table (wow, really?) like the following one I borrowed from [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables);

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |

## Task lists

Sometimes I do things.

- [ ] Figure out why don't they just call these todo lists
- [x] Finish writing this README

## Links

Links are cool. They let us do fancy stuff like remind me that there's a ton of resources out there on how to use Markdown, like [this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) one from GitHub itself!
